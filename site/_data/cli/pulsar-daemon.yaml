  A wrapper around the [`pulsar`](#pulsar) tool that's used to start and stop processes, such as ZooKeeper, bookies, and Pulsar brokers, in the background using [nohup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup).
  
  `pulsar-daemon` has a similar interface to the `pulsar` command but adds `start` and `stop` commands for various services. For a listing of those services, run `pulsar-daemon` to see the help output or see the documentation for the [`pulsar`](#pulsar) command.
commands:
- name: start
  description: Start a service in the background using nohup.
  argument: service
- name: stop
  description: Stop a service that's already been started using [`start`](#pulsar-daemon-start).
  argument: service
  options:
  - flags: -force
    description: Stop the service forcefully if not stopped by normal shutdown.
    default: "false"
