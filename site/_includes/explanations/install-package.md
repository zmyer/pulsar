## System requirements

Pulsar is currently available for **MacOS** and **Linux**. In order to use Pulsar, you'll need to install [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

## Installing Pulsar

To get started running Pulsar, download a binary tarball release in one of the following ways:

* by clicking the link below, which will automatically trigger a download:

  * <a href="{{ binary_release_url }}" download>Pulsar {{ site.current_version }} binary release</a>

* from the Pulsar [downloads page](/download)
* from the Pulsar [releases page](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/releases/latest)
* using [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget):

  ```shell
  $ wget {{ binary_release_url }}
  ```

Once the tarball is downloaded, untar it and `cd` into the resulting directory:

```bash
$ tar xvfz apache-pulsar-{{ site.current_version }}-bin.tar.gz
$ cd apache-pulsar-{{ site.current_version }}
```

## What your package contains

The Pulsar binary package initially contains the following directories:

Directory | Contains
:---------|:--------
`bin` | Pulsar's [command-line tools](../../reference/CliTools), such as [`pulsar`](../../reference/CliTools#pulsar) and [`pulsar-admin`](../../reference/CliTools#pulsar-admin)
`conf` | Configuration files for Pulsar, including for [broker configuration](../../reference/Configuration#broker), [ZooKeeper configuration](../../reference/Configuration#zookeeper), and more
`lib` | The [JAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) files used by Pulsar
`licenses` | License files, in `.txt` form, for various components of the Pulsar [codebase](../../project/Codebase)

These directories will be created once you begin running Pulsar:

Directory | Contains
:---------|:--------
`data` | The data storage directory used by {% popover ZooKeeper %} and {% popover BookKeeper %}
`logs` | Logs created by the installation
