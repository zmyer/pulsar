By default, Pulsar {% popover topics %} are served by a single {% popover broker %}. Using only a single broker, however, limits a topic's maximum throughput. *Partitioned topics* are a special type of topic that can span multiple brokers and thus allow for much higher throughput. For an explanation of how partitioned topics work, see the [Concepts](#concepts) section below.

You can [publish](#publishing-to-partitioned-topics) to partitioned topics using Pulsar's client libraries and you can [create and manage](#managing-partitioned-topics) partitioned topics using Pulsar's [admin API](../../admin-api/overview).

## Publishing to partitioned topics

When publishing to partitioned topics, the only difference from non-partitioned topics is that you need to specify a [routing mode](../../getting-started/ConceptsAndArchitecture#routing-modes) when you create a new {% popover producer %}. Examples for [Java](#java) are below.

### Java

Publishing messages to partitioned topics in the Java client works much like [publishing to normal topics](../../clients/Java#using-producers). The difference is that you need to specify either one of the currently available message routers or a custom router.

#### Routing mode

You can specify the routing mode in the {% javadoc ProducerConfiguration client org.apache.pulsar.client.api.ProducerConfiguration %} object that you use to configure your producer. You have three options:

* `SinglePartition`
* `RoundRobinPartition`
* `CustomPartition`

Here's an example:

```java
String pulsarBrokerRootUrl = "pulsar://localhost:6650";
String topic = "persistent://my-property/my-cluster-my-namespace/my-topic";

PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.create(pulsarBrokerRootUrl);
ProducerConfiguration config = new ProducerConfiguration();
config.setMessageRoutingMode(ProducerConfiguration.MessageRoutingMode.SinglePartition);
Producer producer = client.createProducer(topic, config);
producer.send("Partitioned topic message".getBytes());
```

#### Custom message router

To use a custom message router, you need to provide an implementation of the {% javadoc MessageRouter client org.apache.pulsar.client.api.MessageRouter %} interface, which has just one `choosePartition` method:

```java
public interface MessageRouter extends Serializable {
    int choosePartition(Message msg);
}
```

Here's a (not very useful!) router that routes every message to partition 10:

```java
public class AlwaysTenRouter implements MessageRouter {
    public int choosePartition(Message msg) {
        return 10;
    }
}
```

With that implementation in hand, you can send

```java
String pulsarBrokerRootUrl = "pulsar://localhost:6650";
String topic = "persistent://my-property/my-cluster-my-namespace/my-topic";

PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.create(pulsarBrokerRootUrl);
ProducerConfiguration config = new ProducerConfiguration();
config.setMessageRouter(AlwaysTenRouter);
Producer producer = client.createProducer(topic, config);
producer.send("Partitioned topic message".getBytes());
```
