title: Pulsar Functions overview
lead: A bird's-eye look at Pulsar's lightweight, developer-friendly compute platform
new: true

**Pulsar Functions** are lightweight compute processes that

* consume {% popover messages %} from one or more Pulsar {% popover topics %},
* apply a user-supplied processing logic to each message,
* publish the results of the computation to another topic

Here's an example Pulsar Function for Java:

```java
import java.util.Function;

public class ExclamationFunction implements Function<String, String> {
    @Override
    public String apply(String input) { return String.format("%s!", input); }
}
```

Functions are executed each time a message is published to the input topic. If a function is listening on the topic `tweet-stream`, for example, then the function would be run each time a message.

> Pulsar features automatic message deduplication

## Goals

Core goal: make Pulsar do real heavy lifting without needing to deploy a neighboring system (Storm, Heron, Flink, etc.). Ready-made compute infrastructure at your disposal.

* Developer productivity (easy troubleshooting and deployment)
  * "Serverless" philosophy
* No need for a separate SPE

### Inspirations

* AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, etc.
* FaaS
* Serverless/NoOps philosophy

### Command-line interface

You can manage Pulsar Functions using the [`pulsar-functions`](../../reference/CliTools#pulsar-functions) CLI tool. Here's an example command that would

```bash
$ bin/pulsar-functions localrun \
  --inputs persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/test_src \
  --output persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/test_result \
  --jar examples/api-examples.jar \
  --className org.apache.pulsar.functions.api.examples.ExclamationFunction
```

### Supported languages

Pulsar Functions can currently be written in [Java](../../functions/api#java) and [Python](../../functions/api#python). Support for additional languages is coming soon.

### Runtime

### Deployment modes

* Local run
* Cluster run

### Delivery semantics

* At most once
* At least once
* Effectively once

### State storage

Although you can certainly use Pulsar Functions to perform stateless computations, many use cases demand robust state storage


You can certainly use Pulsar Functions to perform stateless operations, 

By default, Pulsar Functions use [Apache BookKeeper](https://bookkeeper.apache.org) for state storage.

### Metrics

Here's an example function that publishes a value of 1 to the `my-metric` metric.

```java
public class MetricsFunction implements PulsarFunction<String, Void> {
    @Override
    public Void process(String input, Context context) {
        context.recordMetric("my-metric", 1);
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Logging

### Data types

* Strongly typed
