For the purposes of local development and testing, you can run Pulsar in {% popover standalone %} mode on your own machine.

Standalone mode includes a Pulsar {% popover broker %} as well as the necessary {% popover ZooKeeper %} and {% popover BookKeeper %} components running inside of a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM) process.

If you're looking to run a full production Pulsar installation, see the [Deploying a Pulsar instance](../../deployment/InstanceSetup) guide." %}

## Starting the cluster

Once you have an up-to-date local copy of the release, you can start up a local cluster using the [`pulsar`](../../reference/CliTools#pulsar) command, which is stored in the `bin` directory, and specifying that you want to start up Pulsar in {% popover standalone %} mode:

```bash
$ bin/pulsar standalone
```

If Pulsar has been successfully started, you should see `INFO`-level log messages like this:

```
2017-06-01 14:46:29,192 - INFO  - [main:WebSocketService@95] - Global Zookeeper cache started
2017-06-01 14:46:29,192 - INFO  - [main:AuthenticationService@61] - Authentication is disabled
2017-06-01 14:46:29,192 - INFO  - [main:WebSocketService@108] - Pulsar WebSocket Service started
```

{% include admonition.html type="success" title='Automatically created namespace' content='
When you start a local standalone cluster, Pulsar will automatically create a `sample/standalone/ns1` [namespace](../ConceptsAndArchitecture#namespace) that you can use for development purposes. All Pulsar topics are managed within namespaces. For more info, see [Topics](../ConceptsAndArchitecture#topics).' %}

## Testing your cluster setup

Pulsar provides a CLI tool called [`pulsar-client`](../../reference/CliTools#pulsar-client) that enables you to do things like send messages to a Pulsar {% popover topic %} in a running cluster. This command will send a simple message saying `hello-pulsar` to the `persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/my-topic` topic:

```bash
$ bin/pulsar-client produce \
  persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/my-topic \
  -m 'hello-pulsar'
```

If the message has been successfully published to the topic, you should see a confirmation like this in the `pulsar-client` logs:

```
2017-06-01 18:18:57,094 - INFO  - [main:CmdProduce@189] - 1 messages successfully produced
```

{% include admonition.html type="success" title="No need to explicitly create new topics"
content="You may have noticed that we did not explicitly create the `my-topic` topic to which we sent the `hello-pulsar` message. If you attempt to write a message to a topic that does not yet exist, Pulsar will automatically create that topic for you." %}

## Using Pulsar clients locally

Pulsar currently offers client libraries for [Java](../../clients/Java), [Python](../../clients/Python), and [C++](../../clients/Cpp). If you're running a local {% popover standalone %} cluster, you can use one of these root URLs for interacting with your cluster:

* `http://localhost:8080`
* `pulsar://localhost:6650`

Here's an example producer for a Pulsar {% popover topic %} using the [Java](../../clients/Java) client:

```java
String localClusterUrl = "pulsar://localhost:6650";
String namespace = "sample/standalone/ns1"; // This namespace is created automatically
String topic = String.format("persistent://%s/my-topic", namespace);

PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.create(localClusterUrl);
Producer producer = client.createProducer(topic);
```

Here's an example [Python](../../clients/Python) producer:

```python
import pulsar

TOPIC = 'persistent://sample/standalone/ns/my-topic'

client = pulsar.Client('pulsar://localhost:6650')
producer = client.create_producer(TOPIC)
```

Finally, here's an example [C++](../../clients/Cpp) producer:

```cpp
Client client("pulsar://localhost:6650");
Producer producer;
Result result = client.createProducer("persistent://sample/standalone/ns1/my-topic", producer);
if (result != ResultOk) {
    LOG_ERROR("Error creating producer: " << result);
    return -1;
}
```
