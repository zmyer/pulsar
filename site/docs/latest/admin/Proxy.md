The [Pulsar proxy](../../getting-started/ConceptsAndArchitecture#pulsar-proxy) is an optional gateway that you can run over the {% popover brokers %} in a Pulsar {% popover cluster %}. We recommend running a Pulsar proxy in cases when direction connections between clients and Pulsar brokers are either infeasible, undesirable, or both, for example when running Pulsar in a cloud environment or on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) or an analogous platform.

## Running the proxy

In order to run the Pulsar proxy, you need to have both a local and global [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org) quorum set up for use by your Pulsar cluster. For instructions, see [this document](../../deployment/cluster). Once you have ZooKeeper set up and have connection strings for both ZooKeeper quorums, you can use the [`proxy`](../../reference/CliTools#pulsar-proxy) command of the [`pulsar`](../../reference/CliTools#pulsar) CLI tool to start up the proxy (preferably on its own machine or in its own VM):

To start the proxy:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/pulsar/directory
$ bin/pulsar proxy \
  --zookeeper-servers zk-0,zk-1,zk-2 \
  --global-zookeeper-servers zk-0,zk-1,zk-2
```

{% include admonition.html type="success" content="You can run as many instances of the Pulsar proxy in a cluster as you would like." %}

## Stopping the proxy

The Pulsar proxy runs by default in the foreground. To stop the proxy, simply stop the process in which it's running.

## Proxy frontends

We recommend running the Pulsar proxy behind some kind of load-distributing frontend, such as an [HAProxy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-haproxy-and-load-balancing-concepts) load balancer.

## Using Pulsar clients with the proxy

Once your Pulsar proxy is up and running, preferably behind a load-distributing [frontend](#proxy-frontends), clients can connect to the proxy via whichever address is used by the frontend. If the address were the DNS address `pulsar.cluster.default`, for example, then the connection URL for clients would be `pulsar://pulsar.cluster.default:6650`.
