The Pulsar Python client library is a wrapper over the existing [C++ client library](../Cpp) and exposes all of the [same features](../../../../api/cpp). You can find the code in the [`python` subdirectory]({{ site.pulsar_repo }}/pulsar-client-cpp/python) of the C++ client code.

## Installation

You can install the [`pulsar-client`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-client) library either via [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), using [pip](#installation-using-pip), or by building the library from source.

### Installation using pip

To install the `pulsar-client` library as a pre-built package using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager:

```shell
$ pip install pulsar-client
```

Installation via PyPi is available for the following Python versions:

Platform | Supported Python versions
:--------|:-------------------------
MacOS 10.12 (Sierra) and 10.13 (High Sierra) | 2.7, 3.6
Linux | 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6

### Installing from source

To install the `pulsar-client` library by building from source, follow [these instructions](../Cpp#compilation) and compile the Pulsar C++ client library. That will also build the Python binding for the library.

To install the built Python bindings:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/pulsar
$ cd pulsar/pulsar-client-cpp/python
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

## API Reference

The complete Python API reference is available at [api/python]({{site.baseUrl}}/api/python).

## Examples

Below you'll find a variety of Python code examples for the `pulsar-client` library.

### Producer example

This creates a Python {% popover producer %} for the `persistent://sample/standalone/ns/my-topic` topic and send 10 messages on that topic:

```python
import pulsar

TOPIC = 'persistent://sample/standalone/ns/my-topic'
PULSAR_SERVICE_URL = 'pulsar://localhost:6650'

client = pulsar.Client(PULSAR_SERVICE_URL)

producer = client.create_producer(TOPIC)

for i in range(10):
    producer.send('Hello-%d' % i)

client.close()
```

### Consumer example

This creates a {% popover consumer %} with the `my-sub` {% popover subscription %} on the `persistent://sample/standalone/ns/my-topic` topic, listen for incoming messages, print the content and ID of messages that arrive, and {% popover acknowledge %} each message to the Pulsar {% popover broker %}:

```python
SUBSCRIPTION = 'my-sub'

consumer = client.subscribe(TOPIC, SUBSCRIPTION)

while True:
    msg = consumer.receive()
    print("Received message '%s' id='%s'", msg.data(), msg.message_id())
    consumer.acknowledge(msg)

client.close()
```

### Reader interface example

You can use the Pulsar Python API to use the Pulsar [reader interface](../../getting-started/ConceptsAndArchitecture#reader-interface). Here's an example:

```python
# MessageId taken from a previously fetched message
msg_id = msg.message_id()

reader = client.create_reader(TOPIC, msg_id)

while True:
    msg = reader.receive()
    print("Received message '%s' id='%s'", msg.data(), msg.message_id())
    # No acknowledgment
```
